1. Create a R Notebook and install, at least, the following packages: tidyverse, ggplot2, skimr
2. Data Loading and Exploration (15 pts):
a. Load the packages and load the Palmer Penguins dataset.
b. Display the first few rows of the dataset to examine its structure.
c. Provide a brief description of the dataset's variables.
3. Data Summarization (30 pts):
a. Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, max, and min) for
each relevant numeric variable.
b. Create grouped summaries based on penguin species using the `group_by` and
`summarize` functions.
c. Discuss the insights gained from the summarization process. Note any interesting
patterns, anomalies, missing, etc.
d. Apply the skimr5 package to the data and discuss the output. How does it compare
to what you did in the previous steps? What additional information is provided?
How is this useful?
4. Data Visualization (30 pts):
a. Create at least three different types of visualizations using ggplot2 (e.g., scatter plot,
bar plot, box plot, histogram, etc.) to explore relationships between variables.
b. Ensure appropriate labeling, coloring, and titling of the visualizations.
c. Interpret the insights obtained from each visualization.
5. Project Report and Interpretation (25 pts):
a. Compile a comprehensive project report either directly in the R Notebook or, if you
decided not to use a notebook format, an R Script plus a Word document.
b. Summarize overall patterns, trends, or relationships you discovered. What can you
say about each penguin?
c. Reflect on the value of using R and the tidyverse for doing data analysis
